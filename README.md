# Social login boilerplate app

I needed a simple starting point app, it doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, mostly just followed the Railscasts on Devise (user auth) and Omniauth (third party auth).

Feel free to fork this project for your own projects.

# Getting started

Copy config/app_config.EXAMPLE.yml to config/app_config.yml, and populate with your own third-party API keys. 

Remove services you don't need from views/authentications.html.erb
